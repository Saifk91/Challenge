#Challenge Answer 2:
This code is written in Python.
As there are three types of data:
1) Dynamic
2) Meta-data
3) User-data

So this code takes the URL in a variable, further to this adds the types as above and ittirates.
There are chances that within these types there is folder who has has further sub folders hence the next loop itirates through the same.
Once done all the data is loaded in a json file.
